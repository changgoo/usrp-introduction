# Chang-Goo Kim

[Chang-Goo Kim](https://changgoo.github.io) is a research scholar in
the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University, where I joined in September, 2013.

I use numerical simulations to model the star-forming interstellar medium to understand
the inner workings of the star formation, stellar feedback, and galaxy evolution as well as the beauty of the night sky.

I earned the PhD degree from Seoul National University in 2011 and held postdoctoral positions at the University of Western Ontario and the Center for Computational Astrophysics, Flatiron Institute.

I like baseball, tennis, and looking up and taking pictures of the night sky.

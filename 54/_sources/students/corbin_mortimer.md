#Corbin Mortimer

I am a rising junior in the Astrophysical Sciences Department at Princeton. 

I am yet to narrow down my interests, but I am at least somewhat sure that they won't involve exoplanets or instrumentation.

Outside of astro, I am persuing a French minor, as well as considering the SML minor (but in reality I am unlikely to finish it).

```{note}
When I'm not suffering through PSETS, you can find me playing steel pan in the steel pan ensemble, writing the newsletter for the daily princetonian, or running events for the international community as an IC leader!

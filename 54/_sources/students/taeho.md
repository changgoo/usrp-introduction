# Taeho Kim

Hello! My name is **Taeho Kim**. I am a rising senior in astrophysics, focusing on dynamics and theoretical astronomy in general. 

## Interests

- Caffeine
- Stars (Observing, not studying)
- Plentiful sleep

## Research

- JP1: A study on the approximate effect of integrated secular perturbations (ZLK mechanisms) and gravitational-wave–induced dissipation on assumed distributions of hierarchical triple black-hole binaries and the resulting merger population. We present an α-contour mapping of mass-ratio–dependent merger efficiencies and examine the dynamics of the secular averaging regimes.

## ALMA Internship 

- Identifying, displaying, and analyzing L,M-band spectral profiles of post-RSG yellow hypergiants IRAS-17163, IRC+10420, obtaining FWHM/EW values for emission peaks/absorption dips. Correcting and analyzing obtained data and results. Reducing (esoreflex) interferometric data to obtain observables: closure, differential phases and square visibilities to determine physical characteristics of the stellar bodies. Presented final results to ALMA/ESO, then a following presentation to the ESO YHG team.

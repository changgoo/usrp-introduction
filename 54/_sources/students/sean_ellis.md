```{admonition} Hello!

I'm a rising junior in the Astro department here at Princeton. I'm working with Jamey Szalay, looking at how oxygen around Europa interacts with Jupiter's magnetosphere, and trying to uncover various reaction rates between different oxygen-related reactions. I enjoy playing chess and other strategy games, as well as listening to rock and metal music.

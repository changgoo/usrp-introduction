# Jahnavi Murthy Padukone

Hi, my name is Jahnavi Murthy Padukone and I'm from Bangalore, India. I'm a rising senior in the Astrophysics department here at Princeton.

I love to write, crochet, sing and consume spicy foods!

Other than doing Astro research, on campus, I do a cappella, write comedy sketches and perform in musicals with Triangle and PUP. I'm interested in all things computational, and hope to use machine learning and foundation models for astrophysical applications.

Recently, I've done research in using unsupervised ML for redshift prediction, run SIMION simulations for the cross-calibration of the SWAPI instrument aboard the IMAP mission and helped build an optimized electron gun for CEM burn-in with a student group in the Space Lab!

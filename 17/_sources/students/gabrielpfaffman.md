# Gabriel Pfaffman

Hi! I am entering my senior year at Columbia University as an Astrophysics major. I have been passionate about outer space for most of my life, starting with a strong desire to be an astronaut as a child (a dream that was fueled by growing up in Jacksonville, FL -- a relatively close distance to the Kennedy Space Center).

Now, my research interests are galactic dynamics, dark matter, and  dark energy. I am fascinated by the enormous implications these mysterious properties of the universe could bring. The opportunity to push the needle on the human understanding of the natural world is incredibly exciting. I am excited to join a long lineage of explorers and discoverers.

Beyond pushing the bounds of our collective knowledge, I also deeply value teaching. I feel like a critical part of being a part of this long lineage is doing your part in continuing it. Due to this, I would love to be a professor in the future.

Finally, I also have a strong passion for music -- playing, writing, and listening. I have been in several bands starting at the age of 9 and I play several instruments. This passion was introduced to me by my father, who is a jazz musician and teacher. I also enjoy playing tennis in my free time!

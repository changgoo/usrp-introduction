My name is Juston Ward. I'm from Natural Bridge, VA. I am a rising senior in the physics at Sam Houston State University. My goal is to become an astronomer investigating high-energy cosmic phenomena in a variety of Multimessenger domains. More broadly, I just want to do cool research with fun people across the STEM disciplines.

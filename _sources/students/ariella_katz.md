# Ariella Katz

I'm a rising junior in Princeton's Astrophysical Sciences department.

## Interests
Astro-related:
- Cosmology
- We'll see what else!
Other:
- Hiking and the outdoors
- Music and piano
- Thrifting

## Projects
- **A Mathematical Correction for Incompressible Turbulent Magnetic Fields**: Will be working on this this summer!
- **Velocity Morphologies of Milky Way Molecular Clouds**: Examined position-position-velocity datacubes of molecular clouds in the Milky Way to find attributes (velocity gradient, density gradient, etc.) that could indicate the overall velocity structure (in all three dimensions).
- **Black Hole Low Mass X-Ray Binaries**: Obtained the pre-determined BHLMXB candidates available in Gaia DR3 and developed preliminary plots toward determining their formation mechanisms.

## Fun Fact
I will be visiting Bent Spoon frequently this summer.

# Kate Sheldon

My name is Kate Sheldon. I'm a rising junior at Princeton majoring in physics. I am from Santa Barbara, CA. I am 19 years old.

This summer I will be analyzing data from supermassive black holes Sagittarius A* and Messier 87. Using data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), I will measure the polarization of light across different frequencies.

Hi! I'm a rising junior in the astrophysics department here at Princeton. I'm from Santa Cruz, a small surf town in Cali :)

I'm pursuing minors in painting and religion. I am an artist at heart and love to paint, sculpt, sketch, and just generally create art. 
When I'm home I love skateboarding (abandoned pools and parks), and going to the beach. I'm currently working on getting my motorcycle license. 

When I'm not suffering from psets I'm usually hanging out at terrace or the art studio!

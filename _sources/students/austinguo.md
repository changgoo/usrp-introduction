# Austin Guo

Hi everyone, I'm Austin and I'm a rising senior in the Astrophysics department here at Princeton. I'm from Indianapolis (actually Carmel but I just tell people Indianapolis).

For my research interests, well I'm not sure yet. I've done projects on the ISM and exoplanets, but I think I'll be doing dynamics this summer (working with Yubo Su and Caleb Lammers this summer). I have a pretty general interest in astro, but I'm especially interested in black holes, exoplanets, and supernovae. I'm working on getting a French minor as well. Outside of astro, I'm into art history, geography, and history in general. I'd like to think I'm pretty decent at Geoguessr.

## Research Projects
- Developing a machine learning potential to study the interaction of NH3 and H2 in exoplanet atmospheres
- Using ISM simulation data to test assumptions and calculate properties about the cold neutral medium
- Decomposing radio data from a galaxy into its components to calculate tracers
- Whatever I'm doing this summer

## Other Interests
I'm a big music and video games guy - big fan of Radiohead, JPEGMafia, Death Grips, but I've been listening to a lot of Elliott Smith and Fiona Apple recently. My favorite video games include Undertale, Deltarune (new chapters out tomorrow!!) and Omori, but I also play a lot of EU4 (a LOT of hours spent there). I also am trying to watch more things. So far, only anime I've watched is Dungeon Meshi (loved it) and I'm watching Cowboy Bebop right now. If you have some good recs, let me know lol. I'm also a pro wrestling fan (as in the WWE). I also like making goofy mashups of songs.

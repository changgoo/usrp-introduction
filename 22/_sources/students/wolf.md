# Wolf Cukier

I am currently an Undergraduate Student at Princeton University, Class of 2024. I am concentrating (i.e. majoring) in Astrophysical Sciences. I am also getting certificates (i.e. minors) in Planets and Life (Astrobiology), Applications of Computing, and Applied and Computational Mathematics. Although I am sure I want to study something in the realm of astrophysics, I am still exploring my options--astrobiology and exoplanets are two major contenders at this moment.
